# EconMarketStructureProject
This was my "Market Structures Project" which effectively was the Trimester 2 Final. I maxed out the rubric and ended with a solid 130% on the project. The 130% I earned for this project effectively boosted my grade from a 'C' to an 'A'.

#### This Git repository is divided into 2 main folders of content, plus the additional folder for the Images of the Grading Rubric
* #####  The "Try V5" folder is the folder containing all of the uncompiled code. It is the Unity project folder if you with to open and edit the project. It is called Try V5 as it was my 5th attempt at getting the project to work
  * ###### I used Seanba's Tiled2Unity tool in the making of this project, so I thank him for creating a tool to simplify Unity map creation.
* ##### The EconProj2 folder contains a compiled version of the code for Windows x86
